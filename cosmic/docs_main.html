<h3>Cosmic</h3>
<p>
    Cosmic is a simple Javascript and WASM runtime for developing Desktop, Gaming, Backend, and Web applications.
    Our approach is to start with V8 (the fastest script engine) and design a rich API and tools around it.
    To get a gauge of what Cosmic can do now, check out the docs for each API module as well as the <a href="#tools">Tools</a> section.
</p>
<h6>Native API</h6>
<p>
    One of the goals of Cosmic is to provide a cross platform Js/Wasm API to do all the neat things your computer can do.
    This means having a window API, a 2D/3D graphics API, a multimedia API, a networking API, a file system API, and more.
    On top of these basic layers, Cosmic will also provide higher level constructs like a UI framework, an animation API, and more.
</p>
<p>
    Supporting the Web/Node API is a non goal, but we do want to enable similar capabilities. For example, we have implemented "fetch"
    as making http requests from the <a href="http.html">cs.http</a> module.
    Once the Cosmic API is fleshed out more, it shouldn't be hard for one to create a Web polyfill in pure JS. 
</p>
<h6>Conventions</h6>
<p>
    If you've come from Web or Node development you might be wondering how different it is to code in Cosmic:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Importing:</b> We want to support ES modules as the way to import code from local and the web. This is currently not implemented but it is a priority.
        Support for node npm packages is a non goal and will only be considered depending on demand.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Async:</b> All API functions that have an async alternative are synchronous by default.
        For example, <a href="http.html#get">cs.http.get()</a> is synchronous and the async version will be <a href="http.html#getAsync">cs.http.getAsync()</a>.
        Code having clear intentions is a goal for Cosmic.
        One should feel that they can accomplish anything synchronously and only reach for async when they are ready to or planned to.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Errors:</b> Synchronous functions will never throw an exception.
        null will be returned instead and a follow up errCode() or errString() will get you info about the error.
        Exceptions are evil and is an example of hidden control flow we wish to avoid in Cosmic.
        Async promises will be rejected with the error info. errCode and errString are not currently implemented but they are priority features.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h6>Hello World</h6>
<p>Open up your text editor and create hello.js:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Color = cs.graphics.Color

printLine('Hello World!')

const w = cs.window.create('Demo', 1200, 720)
w.onUpdate(g => {
    g.setFontSize(52)
    g.setFillColor(Color.blue)
    g.text(400, 300, 'Hello World!')
})</code></pre>
<p>Then run this in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cosmic run hello.js</code></pre>
