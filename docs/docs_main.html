<h3>Cosmic</h3>
<p>
    Cosmic is a simple Javascript and WASM runtime for developing Desktop, Gaming, Backend, and Web applications.
    Our approach is to start with V8 (the fastest script engine) and design a rich API and tools around it.
    To get a gauge of what Cosmic can do now, check out the docs for each API module as well as the <a href="#tools">Tools</a> section.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: Although the docs and public showcase present everything to be working, Cosmic is still considered experimental software since it's still in its infancy.
</p>
<h6>Native API</h6>
<p>
    One of the goals of Cosmic is to provide a cross platform Js/Wasm API to do all the neat things your computer can do.
    This means having a window API, a 2D/3D graphics API, a multimedia API, a networking API, a file system API, and more.
    On top of these basic layers, Cosmic will also provide higher level constructs like a UI framework, an animation API, and more.
</p>
<p>
    Supporting the Web/Node API is a non goal, but Cosmic will have similar features. For example, "fetch"
    is implemented as making http requests from the <a href="http.html">cs.http</a> module.
    Once the Cosmic API is fleshed out more, it shouldn't be hard for one to create a Web polyfill in pure JS.
</p>
<h6>Conventions</h6>
<p>
    If you've come from Web or Node development you might be wondering how different it is to code in Cosmic:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Importing:</b> Code/dependencies will be imported as ES modules from local and the web.
        Support for node npm packages is a non goal and will only be considered depending on demand.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Async:</b> All API functions that have an async alternative are synchronous by default.
        For example, <a href="http.html#get">cs.http.get()</a> is synchronous and the async version will be <a href="http.html#getAsync">cs.http.getAsync()</a>.
        Code having clear intentions is a goal for Cosmic.
        One should feel that they can accomplish anything synchronously and only reach for async when they are ready to or planned to.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Errors:</b> Synchronous API functions won't throw exceptions for expected errors.
        null will be returned instead and a follow up errCode() or errString() will get you info about the error.
        Async promises will be rejected with the errString() as the message and errCode() in Error.code.
    </li>
</ul>

    Cosmic is aiming to make coding accessible, unrestrictive, productive, fast, and fun! Like what you see? Join our <a href="#community">community</a> and voice your opinions!

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h6>Hello World</h6>
<p>First make sure you have <a href="#install">downloaded</a> Cosmic for your platform. Open up your text editor and create hello.js:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Color = cs.graphics.Color

puts('Hello World!')

const w = cs.window.create('Demo', 1200, 720)
w.onUpdate(g => {
    g.fontSize(52)
    g.fillColor(Color.blue)
    g.text(400, 300, 'Hello World!')
})</code></pre>
<p>Then run this in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cosmic hello.js</code></pre>

<p>Try out more examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/fubark/cosmic.git
cosmic cosmic/examples/paddleball.js
cosmic cosmic/examples/demo.js
</code></pre>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>One of the goals for Cosmic is to provide useful tools to help you develop software.</p>

<div><b>cosmic run</b> foo.js</div>
<p>This runs your script with the cosmic runtime. You can also run foo.js with "cosmic foo.js".</p>
<div><b>cosmic dev</b> foo.js</div>
<p>This runs your script but also watches it for changes to do hot reloading. This feature is not implemented yet.</p>
<div><b>cosmic test</b> foo.test.js</div>
<p>Runs tests in foo.test.js.</p>
<div><b>cosmic exe</b> foo.js</div>
<p>Creates a single binary executable for your app at foo.js. This feature is not implemented yet.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to target the Web as a platform and it will generate the html/js bundle you'll need.</p>
<p>Eventually you'll be able to create an executable for a foreign target platform!</p>
<div><b>cosmic http</b> ./public 8081</div>
<p>Starts hosting a HTTP web server over your static files in the public directory.</p>
<div><b>cosmic https</b> ./public my.crt my.key 8081</div>
<p>Like `cosmic http` but secure. You'll need to supply your public and private keys.</p>
<div><b>cosmic shell</b></div>
<p>Starts a shell where you can do some quick calculations or experiment before creating a script.</p>
<div><b>cosmic *more*</b></div>
