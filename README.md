## Scripting
[Cyber](https://github.com/fubark/cyber) will be the primary scripting language used in Cosmic.
The engine will be language agnostic, allowing interop with other languages.

## Contributing
We will be building the app primarily in Zig.
[Why Zig When There is Already C++, D, and Rust?](https://ziglang.org/learn/why_zig_rust_d_cpp)

Zig's toolchain is ideal for this project. Even though it has yet to reach 1.0, it's LLVM backend is stable and stage2 is just around the corner.

There is a lot to be done! If you find the project interesting, consider submitting a PR. A good way to start is to submit or repond to an existing Github Issue. Please star the repo and let's do this!

If you have questions or suggestions, submit an issue or join the discord for more direct discourse.
